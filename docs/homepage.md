# Dot Hop

Welcome to the Dot Hop docs site! This, as well as Dot Hop itself, is a work in progress!

* [All the Places](https://russmatney.github.io/dothop/#/all-the-places) - Dot Hop is available on several platforms - this page lists them all!
* Check out the [Changelog](/changelog) for the latest code updates.

## Lately (End of July 2025)

I released Dot Hop 1.2 yesterday! Today I'm writing up release notes for Steam,
Itch, and Github - then hopefully releasing on Flathub today or tomorrow.

There've been a few Dot Hop devlogs on my blog this summer, and a full 1.0
playthrough on twitch.

A fun bug I hit led to this craziness:

An early clip of the Puzzle Gym and Random Mode:

An early bit of next-move emphasis:

## Lately (Summer 2025)

I'm working hard on Dot Hop 2.0, which will release for Desktop, SteamDeck, iOS, and Android.

Reach out if you're interested in playtesting the beta! Things work on mobile,
but I'm seeking feedback and ideas for better layouts, interactions, and new
mechanics.
