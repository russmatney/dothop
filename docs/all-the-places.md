# All The Places

Suddenly I'm supporting Dot Hop on several platforms! Here's a list of where to
find the game and how you can support it.

> TLDR:
>
> I've priced Dot Hop at `$3.99` on
> [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779710/Dot_Hop/), iOS, and
> [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dangerrussgames.dothop),
> but it's available for free in several places too -
> [Itch.io](https://russmatney.itch.io/dot-hop) (pay what you want), Flathub
> (coming soon, linux-only), via Github Releases (coming soon), and via invite to the iOS
> beta (ping me!).
>
> If you want to contribute to Dot Hop's continued development, you can donate
> via [Patreon](www.patreon.com/russmatney),
> [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/russmatney), or [Github
> Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/russmatney/).
>
> I've written and made video content about Dot Hop on [my
> blog](https://russmatney.com), on
> [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@russmatney), and on
> [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/russmatney).

### Flathub

Coming soon!

### Github Releases

Coming soon!


### iOS

Now in Beta via TestFlight! Spots are more limited than Android, so ping me
wherever ([discord](https://discord.gg/QcubhWef84) encouraged) if you'd like an
invite!

Runs on iPhone and iPad.

### Android

#### Google Play - $3.99 for open beta

The game is in `Open Beta` [on the Google Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dangerrussgames.dothop).
For Google Play, Open Beta does not mean free, so to download there, it'll cost `$3.99`.

#### `.apk`s via itch.io

I've started pushing Android `.apk`s to [the Dot Hop itch
page](https://russmatney.itch.io/dot-hop).

> Feel free to set it to $0 and try it out! Feedback and donations are
> encouraged and appreciated but quite optional!

## Supporting Development

[Danger Russ Games](https://dangerrussgames.com) is my solo-gamedev studio. I'm
burning through savings while I try to sell enough games to make the rent. Any
and all support (playtest feedback or a few bucks) is greatly appreciated!

### Patreon

* [Support me on Patreon](www.patreon.com/russmatney)

I've been writing almost monthly updates here for a few years.

### Ko-fi

* [Buy me a Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/russmatney)

### Github Sponsorship

* [Sponsor `russmatney` on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/russmatney/)

I recently got my first github sponsor! This was less because of Dot Hop and
more because of [Log.gd](https://russmatney.github.io/log.gd/#/) (a Godot Addon
I now can't live without) - but I'll take it! :D

### Pay-what-you-want on Itch.io

You can contribute any amount when buying the game on itch!

## Devlogs

I write devlogs on [my blog](https://russmatney.com) - here are some Dot Hop ones:

## Youtube

I have a few Youtube devlogs covering Dot Hop as well:
