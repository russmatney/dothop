# CHANGELOG


## Untagged


### 24 Jul 2025

- ([`7cd76f9`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/7cd76f9)) fix: prevent crash when assigning null to int - Russell Matney

  > :eyeroll:

- ([`f7c16af`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/f7c16af)) fix: await puzzle transitions - Russell Matney

  > The transitions were not running for several reasons - this refactors to
  > support awaiting signals before removing the puzzle node from the
  > container.

- ([`bc9e2ae`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/bc9e2ae)) refactor: intro PuzzleNodeExtender (name pending) - Russell Matney

  > Refactors more of the GameScene into smaller PuzzleNodeExtender
  > Components - these components are bits of logic around puzzle features
  > and lifecycle. The DotHopPuzzle now features a rebuild_puzzle(opts)
  > helper for creating and re-creating-with-minimal-input the puzzle node
  > itself, which removes a bunch of responsibility from the puzzle node
  > container/parent.

- ([`d36dafc`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/d36dafc)) refactor: pull GameMusic and HUD refs out of GameScene - Russell Matney

  > Note this drops the puzzle-progress panel. (it's still there, just
  > depends on a HUD reference at the moment)

- ([`a9e2470`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/a9e2470)) refactor: break sounds out of game scene - Russell Matney

  > love this reusable, self-contained node pattern!

- ([`e641666`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/e641666)) wip: add return to main, clean up threads on nav - Russell Matney

  > This thread clean up blocks navigation until analysis is done! but
  > doesn't leak threads. TODO write a PuzzleAnalyzer autoload to own these
  > threads so we don't block in exit_tree like this.

- ([`79646a7`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/79646a7)) feat: reasonable layout for puzzles in puzz-browser - Russell Matney

  > Tweaks the phantom-camera group follow margins to keep even large puzzles fully
  > in view

- ([`9c7de49`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/9c7de49)) feat: drop in phantom camera - Russell Matney

  > Moving to a more fully-featured phantom camera - this'll at least let us
  > drop our scrappy camera positioning/centering code, which doesn't seem
  > to be working anyway.

- ([`3c862cc`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/3c862cc)) deps: add phantom camera - Russell Matney

### 23 Jul 2025

- ([`6ba03f8`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/6ba03f8)) fix: drop parameterized test setup - Russell Matney

  > it anyway.

- ([`1e2df74`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/1e2df74)) chore: better log.gd colors - Russell Matney

- ([`c338ecd`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/c338ecd)) deps: update gdunit (uid-re-adds coming later) - Russell Matney
- ([`d82a483`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/d82a483)) deps: update AsepriteWizard - Russell Matney

### 22 Jul 2025

- ([`4991402`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/4991402)) fix: correct fall theme, fix camera zoom - Russell Matney

  > Time to bring in phantom camera, i think

- ([`8ebd1f6`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/8ebd1f6)) feat: puzzle browser running analysis in the background - Russell Matney

- ([`74f1d7b`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/74f1d7b)) feat: run puzzle data export in background - Russell Matney

  > Uses threads to prevent locking the editor while the puzzle data export
  > runs.

- ([`f2eb65a`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/f2eb65a)) fix: restore tests! - Russell Matney

  > - Skipping multi-hopper analysis (currently this loops forever)
  > - adding test puzzle_nodes to the tree to prevent crashes
  > - moving back to including a PuzzleState.Cell at every coord
  > - restore a poorly ported store test

- ([`5b21f55`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/5b21f55)) fix: no more log.gd [/color] closing tags - Russell Matney

  > Apparently it's unreasonable to print bbcode with nested square braces,
  > which is unfortunate. Until i can dig in more, this swaps the array
  > wrappers with paren-pipes: (| |). Not sure i like them, but at least
  > rainbow delims are working.

- ([`bf4015a`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/bf4015a)) feat: naive (untested) log.gd rainbow delimiters - Russell Matney

  > Quick feature that is great for readability! Will port this back to
  > log.gd soon.

- ([`831f30c`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/831f30c)) chore: update changelog - Russell Matney

## v1.1.1


### 20 Jul 2025

- ([`2d9138b`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/2d9138b)) wip: toying with camera _ready puzzle-node lookup - Russell Matney

  > It'd be nice if the camera could grab the puzzle-node without needing
  > setup elsewhere


### 19 Jul 2025

- ([`de70124`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/de70124)) feat: link to puzzle browser on main menu - Russell Matney

- ([`e4a77c0`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/e4a77c0)) refactor: pull theme_data from world directly - Russell Matney

  > Moving away from the theme pandora entity, which should shrink down.
  > 
  > Also adds an AllTheDots theme_data and a new world called Extra Extra,
  > which includes a few more puzzles, including a few 2 hoppers and the
  > extra difficult one from cameron

- ([`db6a485`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/db6a485)) chore: drop demo flag - Russell Matney

- ([`20558e7`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/20558e7)) refactor: puzzle_set -> world, plus event renaming - Russell Matney

- ([`55e334c`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/55e334c)) rename: PuzzleSet -> PuzzleWorld - Russell Matney
- ([`f0ed108`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/f0ed108)) chore: misc log clean up and what not - Russell Matney

  > Things back to working, now with 'GameDef'!
  > 
  > Hurting for a bit more of a refactor - we're relying on PuzzleSet
  > entities for game state/save data, when we probably want something less
  > global, and more game mode aware.
  > 
  > Plus i really want a PuzzleStore that has reasonable apis to pull
  > from. (But in what game-mode context? Is PuzzleStore game-mode dependent
  > or agnostic?)

- ([`8fed2df`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/8fed2df)) refactor: move rest of GameDef into DHData, PuzzleDef - Russell Matney

  > Moved away from the extra GridCell class completely.

- ([`d8ae104`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/d8ae104)) refactor: move camera code out of dothop puzzle - Russell Matney

  > Lots of complexity in the name of running the dothoppuzzle scene
  > directly. reminds me of the one-room-in-full-dungeon-map problem in
  > metsys - could write a little run-in-context helper if we need.

- ([`334749d`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/334749d)) wip: game (sort of) playable again! - Russell Matney

  > Fixes the .puzz importer and reassigns psds to pandora PuzzleSets.

- ([`4d6777d`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/4d6777d)) refactor: move other puzzle txts to .puzz, drop puzzle-set-data tres - Russell Matney
- ([`701cc5e`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/701cc5e)) wip: support psd.setup, add shuffle input mapping - Russell Matney

  > The .puzz -> puzzle-set-data only saves/loads the @exported fields.
  > setup() is a quick workaround that will reparse the puzzle_defs if
  > needed.
  > 
  > We're not yet restoring the game state properly.

- ([`83d0a45`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/83d0a45)) chore: drop game_def instance support - Russell Matney

  > Just a bunch of static funcs left now.

- ([`9116714`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/9116714)) wip: removing game_def from PuzzleSet pandora entity - Russell Matney

  > Trying to restore the game state - looks like puzzle_set_datas don't
  > automatically load their puzzle_defs just yet.


### 18 Jul 2025

- ([`2409776`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/2409776)) wip: more puzzle vs game scene ironing - Russell Matney

  > Lifts some puzzle-node signals to the game scene, cleans up a bunch of
  > signal connects. I suspect much of these can be moved to per-node
  > _ready() funcs - probably connecting signals right before add_child is
  > an anti-pattern.

- ([`6074816`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/6074816)) wip: DotHopPuzzle clean up, and a quick reshuffle button - Russell Matney

  > warning! Things still quite broken at the moment!

  > Refactoring puzzle parsing into an editor import plugin.

- ([`eefb5a0`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/eefb5a0)) feat: StatLogger writing json and md puzzle data files - Russell Matney

  > to consume the json from babashka to print docs and devlog posts.

- ([`cb670f8`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/cb670f8)) wip: initial stat-logger via UI button - Russell Matney

  > only doing this to improve CI times.
  > 
  > We should add EXTRA as a new world after you watch/find a secret in the credits.

- ([`595e4b6`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/595e4b6)) feat: ignore 'stuck-goal' choices - Russell Matney

  > players wouldn't logically choose to exit early, so we shouldn't
  > consider it a 'choice' when working with difficulty

- ([`eef16a6`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/eef16a6)) chore: adds a table-like printer to support copy-pasting puzzle data - Russell Matney
- ([`697c349`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/697c349)) fix: re-enable solve-all-puzzles-tests - Russell Matney
- ([`89fed8d`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/89fed8d)) feat: calcing choices and turn counts per path - Russell Matney

  > Adding supporting for choice and turn counts in the analysis, plus
  > getting some more useful types in here.


### 15 Jul 2025

- ([`fee2fa8`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/fee2fa8)) wip: tracking and emitting possible next moves - Russell Matney

### 14 Jul 2025

- ([`ef209a2`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/ef209a2)) refactor: cleaner check_moves logic - Russell Matney
- ([`df573d1`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/df573d1)) fix: update hopped-dot tracking test - Russell Matney
- ([`513ac53`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/513ac53)) wip: refactoring into a Move monoid - Russell Matney

  > instead of a list of moves, we create one Move per hopper.


### 20 Jun 2025

- ([`c2f9eac`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/c2f9eac)) wip: toying with some altered multi-hopper logic - Russell Matney
- ([`a355bbb`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/a355bbb)) fix: use installed gdunit - Russell Matney
- ([`52cabaa`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/52cabaa)) fix: out of bounds puzzle index fix - Russell Matney

- ([`adcdf10`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/adcdf10)) refactor: puzzle analysis supports state-only runs - Russell Matney

  > The puzzle analysis now accepts are :node or :state param - pass in
  > either a DotHopPuzzle or a PuzzleState, and it'll use move() from either
  > to brute-force the puzzles.

- ([`29da073`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/29da073)) refactor: remove node refs from PuzzleState - Russell Matney

  > Instead of handling nodes and calling methods in PuzzleState, we emit
  > signals. It's on the consumer (DotHopPuzzle) to connect to these from
  > Player and Dot nodes.

- ([`6c29623`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/6c29623)) test: better PuzzleState test coverage - Russell Matney

  > Adds a few more assertions to make sure things are behaving as expected
  > - some larger puzzles, undos, and checking on moves vs apply moves.
  > 
  > Setting up some strong test coverage before starting to gut/refactor the
  > messy state funcs.


### 19 Jun 2025

- ([`342ef0a`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/342ef0a)) fix: don't call node funcs on null nodes - Russell Matney

  > Add some guards, reorders some logic to run the game state updates
  > without calling DotHopPlayer or DotHopDot node funcs. These should be
  > kicked to signals instead.

- ([`688e569`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/688e569)) refactor: pull apply_moves and rest of logic into PuzzleState - Russell Matney

  > Tests crashing b/c of PuzzleState node deps, but the DotHopPuzzle node
  > is now free of PuzzleState logic. Very close to running the game logic
  > without needing any nodes.

- ([`3373cd2`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/3373cd2)) refactor: pull check_move into PuzzleState, add PuzzleState unit tests - Russell Matney

  > Fixes a few bugs and adds unit tests for basic PuzzleState funcs to be
  > sure things are working as expected.
  > 
  > Restores working puzzles, tho there are definitely some quirks - e.g.
  > emitting win too early.
  > 
  > Moves from reading grid directly to 'rebuilding' rows on request -
  > likely only relevant for testing.


### 18 Jun 2025

- ([`abab86e`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/abab86e)) wip: dropping 'grid' in favor of coord->cell dict - Russell Matney

  > Mildly breaks everything! Tests failing, game logic needs to be fixed.

- ([`a0bde29`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/a0bde29)) wip: moving away from string 'objs' in cells - Russell Matney
- ([`f0c3c01`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/f0c3c01)) chore: add remove_nulls to bones.util - Russell Matney

- ([`8f692a8`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/8f692a8)) refactor: create cells when building state the first time - Russell Matney

  > The state's grid gets updated in place, but the cells don't - kind of
  > wonky.

- ([`a65dd99`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/a65dd99)) refactor: split move into check_moves and apply_moves - Russell Matney

  > I think this is the command pattern? Nice to separate the data and the
  > execution of it.

- ([`b0559e7`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/b0559e7)) refactor: break PuzzState into PuzzleState class - Russell Matney
- ([`0922d19`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/0922d19)) refactor: pull more logic into PuzzState, use types to avoid warnings - Russell Matney

  > Ideally the analysis would run without any nodes - right now we're
  > strapped on top of the DotHopPuzzle node, itself.

- ([`980cde8`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/980cde8)) fix: misc fixups after DotHopPuzzle refactor - Russell Matney

### 3 Jun 2025

- ([`cbd630c`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/cbd630c)) build: setup dupe android build for local-prod tests - Russell Matney

  > Rather than edit the android export, we dupe it and make perma-tweaks
  > there.

- ([`3e22379`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/3e22379)) fix: restore pandora compressed-read-error work-around - Russell Matney

  > For whatever reason the android release of the game does not build the
  > expected pandora data file as expected - this restores a workaround that
  > i lost when pandora was last updated. I ought to get this into a pandora
  > issue soon!

- ([`b657839`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/b657839)) fix: don't run tween infinitely - Russell Matney

- ([`6aa9c6f`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/6aa9c6f)) refactor: pull more dotHopPuzzle impl into PuzzState class - Russell Matney

  > type.

- ([`4710665`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/4710665)) refactor: move ensure_cam to camera static func - Russell Matney

- ([`b004d55`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/b004d55)) refactor: more sweeping rearrangement - Russell Matney

  > Grouping more scripts: core, audio dirs introduced.

  > otherwise github ignores _sidebar.md, etc.

- ([`f17e2ff`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/f17e2ff)) refactor: rename puzzle dir to 'dothop', move more things into 'puzzles' - Russell Matney

  > Re-orging the src dir a bit - trying to parse the DotHopPuzzle and
  > GameScene apart a bit.

- ([`9bd8fac`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/9bd8fac)) feat: add version label to main menu - Russell Matney

## v1.1.0


### 29 May 2025

- ([`470d12e`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/470d12e)) chore: increment android release number - Russell Matney
- ([`937e42c`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/937e42c)) feat: add floaty particles to rest of themes - Russell Matney

  > Not great, but it's something.

- ([`acda5fd`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/acda5fd)) refactor: drop game_def_path usage - Russell Matney

  > Moving away from specifying these games - it seems only to be used for
  > the legend, which is pretty unnecessary at this point - really we just
  > need the puzzle shapes parsed.

- ([`441f351`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/441f351)) refactor: rename dothop-n.txt files - Russell Matney
- ([`72fba57`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/72fba57)) refactor: rename PuzzleScene -> DotHopPuzzle, wrap puzzle-set-paths - Russell Matney

  > Introduces a new custom resource, PuzzleSetData. this is a wrapper for
  > the (poorly named) dothop-one/two/three/etc.txt files. We now reference
  > these resources directly and use them to parse a GameDef.

- ([`10c3b34`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/10c3b34)) wip: keeping pandora puzzle themes, simplifying puzzle-theme-data - Russell Matney

  > I was intending to drop some pandora bits, but after more thought and
  > some circular dependency issues, i've decided to just simplify it
  > instead. Pandora has nice visualization/UI features, and is a better
  > option to attach to nodes - e.g. the puzzlescene can reference a
  > PuzzleTheme, but not puzzle theme data

- ([`666dc05`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/666dc05)) feat: floaty spring particles - Russell Matney
- ([`02812de`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/02812de)) feat: some dot movement animations - Russell Matney

- ([`af81818`](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop/commit/af81818)) fix: edit one control at a time, listen to _input() - Russell Matney

  > Better flow for updating controls - editing a second control will cancel
